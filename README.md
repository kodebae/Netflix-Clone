# Netflix-Clone

## Project Overview

This is a Netflix landing page clone created with vanilla HTML and CSS.
The purpose of this project is to showcase how much of a website that can be cloned with simple HTML and CSS without 
the use of any JavaScript. This project utilizes basic flexbox within the CSS. Media queries were added for responsiveness. 
The cursor changes on hoover as well as the background of the buttons. Buttons are disabled as I do not own Netflix.
